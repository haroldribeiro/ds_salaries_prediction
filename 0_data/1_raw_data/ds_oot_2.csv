You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
