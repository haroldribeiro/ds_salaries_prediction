Our mission at Farmstead is to make fresh, high-quality food accessible to everyone. We're a new delivery-only grocer that's re-inventing grocery from the ground up. We focus on mid-market customers (think Safeway, Kroger, etc) and bring them a best-in-class grocery product experience right to their doorsteps, even in areas traditionally underserved by supermarket chains. We accomplish this by writing consumer-facing and operations orchestration code that allows us to be highly efficient relative to legacy supermarkets.

Your Duties

You're in close contact with our patrons and go above and beyond to help them. You'll work on a laptop remotely to monitor a variety of inboxes where our customers reach out to us. You will take customer calls and reach out to them via phone at their request and when necessary.

Drivers rely on you to help them deliver to customers. If they need help finding a residence, or reaching out to a customer that isn't responding, you are their lifeline for assistance. You'll monitor their progress as they make deliveries to ensure that they are dropping off orders in a timely manner, and you'll inform customers if there is any delay.

A positive, pro-active attitude when problem-solving. The road to success isn't a straight line. In time, you've learned your job well enough to navigate around difficulties as they arise. You're also willing to speak to your colleagues on how to best handle situations that are unknown to you.

A genuine desire to help our customers with any conflicts they encounter. You're not here to clock in and clock out, but to help each customer remember why they chose Farmstead for all their grocery-delivery needs.
