Data Scientist,$91K - $171K (Glassdoor est.),"As a company they’re running an initiative to create customer health scores. They take data from several different places – quantitative and some not as quantitative (feedback, survey scoring). Trying to marry all this information together and figure out what’s important. Setting up a framework to figure out how to define which data is important and then create an algorithm that will spit the data out. There’s a team in place that’s working on it – a cross functional team with stakeholders across rapid7. There’s also a lead data scientist and the data engineering team that can support this project. They have a basic framework they can work within too and will be working closely with the Manager, Luke. Need someone with good modeling skills to determine important variables and some algorithmic knowledge- algorithmic approach because they need explain ability at certain steps. R or Python is fine – they use both. They use Tableau for visualizations – even if their visualization experience is using R or Python that’s fine, more of a benefit. Need someone who can understand variable importance to help them understand how to structure an algorithm. Don’t need deep learning or deep AI experience, business focused data science rather than research based so someone coming out of Healthcare would not be a fit. Benefit if they understand B2B, SAAS company model.
